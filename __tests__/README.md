## React Testing Library notes

https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro

### Tests should have the following naming pattern:
Web: `*.test.jsx`

Native React: `*.test.native.jsx`

Test for React versions without hooks: `*.no-hook.test.jsx` (these tests will be tested with a hookless version and a hook version of React. )
